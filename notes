1. If n is in 100's or 1000's go for naive solution first, even if it's inefficient.
2. If some solution exists for a sub problem, copy paste it, and focus on main problem, for example if you need to find primes, you can search for an efficient algorithm from google and paste it.
3. when using multiple iterations of inputs, dont forget to clear common resources like maps
4. If you can try to simplify the problem as much as possible, like see if you can do something with modulos.
5. 


















few code templates
//traverse through map
for(auto &i:mod){
    cout<<i.first<<" "<<i.second<<endl;
}

//find a key exist in a map
if(mod.find(mm)==mod.end())
